Challenge A: Data input
1. Read in the attached data set (Spider infection data)
2. Associate the column titles with the data
3. View the column titles and first few lines of data to ensure that it has been read in
4. View all data


Hints: 
•	The attached file is an excel document, but R is poor at reading all the excel formatting and prefers ."csv" format. (You may want to resave the file as a new file type)
•	When you read in data, you will want to give the dataset a name within R so that you can reference and use it.
spider_data<-read.csv(" <file_path>" )   [Replace <file_path> with the location of the data on your computer.

Useful commands
read.csv( )
attach (spider_data)
head (spider_data)
Also try just typing the name of your dataset to see what happens.

Challenge B: Data description
1. Find the mean spider mass
2. Find the standard deviation of nematode number across both sites
Bonus points: Find the standard deviation of nematode number by site

Useful commands
mean( <Column name>)
sd( <Column name>)

Challenge C: Data visualization
1. Make a graph that conveys spider mass in the two sites in a way that is clear and aesthetically appealing.
Bonus points: 
Place the spider graph side-by-side with a similar graph that shows nematode abundance in the sites.
Plot spider size against the number of nematodes that infects it.

Useful commands
Plot (<Column 1>~ <Column 2>)
Boxplot (<Column 1>~ <Column 2>)
